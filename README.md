# Face-To-Camera-Distance-Estimation
This is a mini-project for detecting the face and tries to estimates the distance between the face and the camera. This project is implemented in C++ with OpenCV. In order to perform face detection, we used the Haar Cascade Classifier that proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones.
